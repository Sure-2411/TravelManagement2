**TravelManagement2**
TravelManagement2 is a full-stack web application designed to manage various aspects of travel. It is built with a clear separation between the frontend and backend, enabling a modular and scalable approach to development. This platform aims to provide a robust solution for tracking, booking, and organizing travel plans.

Key Features
User Management: Secure user registration, authentication, and profile management.

Travel Itinerary: Create, view, and manage detailed travel itineraries.

Booking Management: Handle flights, hotels, and other travel-related bookings.

Search and Discovery: Search for and explore different travel destinations and services.

Tech Stack
The project utilizes the following technologies:

Frontend:

Angular using TypeScript (45.4%): Provides type safety and enhances code maintainability.

HTML (31.0%): Structures the web pages.

CSS (23.6%): Handles the styling and visual presentation of the application.

Framework: ANngular and Springboot.

Backend:

The project contains a Backend using SpringBoot.


Database:

The DB/Dump20250602 folder contains a database dump, likely from a relational database system like MySQL. This dump is used to set up the local development database.

Repository Structure
The project is organized into the following main directories:

Backend/: The server-side application, including all API endpoints, business logic, and database interactions.

DB/: Database-related files, including the initial schema and data dump.

Frontend/: The client-side application, containing all the UI components, assets, and frontend logic.

Getting Started
Follow these steps to get the project up and running on your local machine.

Prerequisites
Node.js & npm: Required for running the frontend.

A database server: You will need to have a database server (e.g., MySQL) installed and running to restore the provided dump.

A code editor: We recommend using a powerful editor like VS Code.

1. Clone the Repository
Start by cloning the repository and navigating into the project directory.

git clone https://github.com/Sure-2411/TravelManagement2.git
cd TravelManagement2

2. Database Setup
Create a new database and restore the provided dump to populate it with the necessary tables and data.

# First, create an empty database.
# Replace `[database_name]` with your chosen name.
CREATE DATABASE [database_name];

# Then, navigate to the DB folder and restore the dump.
# Replace `[username]` and `[database_name]` with your credentials.
mysql -u [username] -p [database_name] < DB/Dump20250602/dump.sql

3. Backend Setup
Navigate to the Backend directory, install its dependencies, and start the server. You may need to configure the database connection details in a file (e.g., a .env file) inside this directory.

cd Backend/

# Example for a Node.js project:
npm install
npm start

# Example for a Java project:
# ./mvnw spring-boot:run

4. Frontend Setup
In a separate terminal, navigate to the Frontend directory, install the required packages, and launch the development server.

cd Frontend/
npm install
npm start

Your frontend application should now be running and communicating with the backend API.
